# Random Dungeon Generation

#### TODO:
 * Add a config file to have seperate setups for Ryan and Brandon (e.g. file directories)
 * Add chip/crystal nodes to the bottom of non nessisary branches to make them nessisary
 * Make the graph configurable by width and height
 * Make a graph vis function (Use scipi and matplotlib)
 * Add water and flippers
 * Re-do the graph check to work with any type of graphs

#### Future World:
  * Add enemies
  * Block pushing puzzles (how do we handle this in the solver)
  * Add obsticals besides the door
  * Layout the leves using something besides random (Based on an image) (symitrize)
  * Allow the user to provide some interesting layout information
  * Rate a bunch of levels and try to figure out what makes a level good
