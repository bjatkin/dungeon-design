# Random Dungeon Generation

#### TODO:
 * [x] Add a config file to have separate setups for Ryan and Brandon (e.g. file directories)
 * [x] Add chip/crystal nodes to the bottom of non necessary branches to make them necessary
 * Make the graph configurable by width and height
 * [x] Make a graph vis function (Use scipi and matplotlib)
 * [x] Add water and flippers

#### Future World:
  * Add enemies
  * Block pushing puzzles (how do we handle this in the solver)
  * Add obstacles besides the door
  * [x] Layout the levels using something besides random (Based on an image) (make symmetrical)
  * Allow the user to provide some interesting layout information
  * Rate a bunch of levels and try to figure out what makes a level good
